# Loginsystem
I developed this login system using python with django framework basically contains the signin,signup,reset password,forget password functionalities.
SETUP VIRTUAL VENV
 Navigate to where you want to keep your django projects. I use D://DjangoProjects/
 Create D://DjangoProjects/ChatServerPlayground folder or whatever you want to name the project.
 Create a virtual environment to run the project in.
 Typically I call it "venv" but you can call it something else if you like. Doesn't matter. djangoproject_venv for example.
 python -m venv venv or python -m venv djangoproject_venv if you like
 Open a cmd prompt in your project directly
 Navigate into venv folder
 cd venv
 Activate the virtual environment
  Windows: Scripts\activate
  Linux: source bin/activate
  Mac (I think): source bin/activate
Than open command prompt and navigate to the loginsystem and run the project.
One point to remember is that when you are using forget password the link to reset password is provided on command prompt.
